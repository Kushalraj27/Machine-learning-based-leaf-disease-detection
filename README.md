# machine-learning-based-leaf-disease-detection

Developed a Machine Learning-based system for automatic leaf disease detection, using image processing and classification algorithms to identify and categorize plant diseases accurately, helping in early diagnosis and improved crop management

NumPy – Provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and mathematical operations, useful for numerical computations in ML.

Pandas – Used for data handling and preprocessing (e.g., reading CSV files, cleaning and organizing dataset).

PyTorch – A deep learning framework for building, training, and evaluating the custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

Matplotlib – A plotting library used to visualize data, training loss, and accuracy trends.

Seaborn – A statistical data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib, used for heatmaps, distribution plots, and more insightful visualizations.

Torch (core) – The base package of PyTorch, providing core tensor operations and autograd for building deep learning models
